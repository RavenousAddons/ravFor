# What is Ravenous For â€¦ for?

So far, this Addon creates a new window that keeps track of a number of features in *Shadowlands* that will help improve your characters gear and widen your collections. The Addon will create a General Macro for you called "Ravenous For", if space is available, to simplify opening and closing the window.

**What's tracked so far:**

1. Rares that you've killed for the day in the following Zones:
    1. Korthia
    2. The Maw
    3. Maldraxxus
    4. Revendreth
    5. Bastion
    6. Ardenweald
2. Items dropped by each Rare:
    1. Mounts
    2. Pets
    3. Toys
    4. Cosmetics
    5. Items

In addition, the Addon provides other information, like whether certain Rares require a particular Covenant to summon, or if certain mounts are restricted to another Covenant.

It's also set up to provide some light quality-of-life tooling to people on Rare Runs. So far this includes:

1. Clicking on a Rare's name will:
    1. Generate a Map Pin Location and automatically track it for you
    2. Print details of the Rare and its location in your default chat window, including the shareable Map Pin Location.
    3. *If you're the leader of your group, it will silently ping the details of the Rare over to your other group members, triggering (i) and (ii) for them if they have the Addon as well.*
    4. *If the leader of your group pinged a Rare's location, there will also be a Raid Warning repeating the details of what was printed in your default chat window*

## Usage

As mentioned above, Ravenous For *Shadowlands* will automatically create a General Macro for you called "Ravenous For". This macro simply opens and closes the main window of the Addon, but if you like, you can also use the following slash-command:

`/ravfor`

There are also a handful of configuration settings which will alter how the Addon presents information to you. You can open the settings using the button on top of the main window or with the following slash-command:

`/ravfor config`
